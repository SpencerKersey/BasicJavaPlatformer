# BasicJavaPlatformer
This is a basic 2D platformer program which allows the user to jump around interact with various objects. At the moment there is no win/lose scenario and is mainly just for the purpose of learning how to create a program like this.

## Currently Implemented Features
* Dynamic window resizing to allow for the game to run at any resolution
* Disconnected gameplay from the window output meaning the game internally runs at 1600x900 to ensure consistency
* Player can jump and run around with correctly handled gravity and floor/wall collision
* Basic homescreen has been implemented to allow for a more seamless experience
